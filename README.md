## Valor Legends Info App!
### Webapp showing useful information
#### Lots of stuff missing, feel free to contriboot

And feel free to [check it out here](https://valor.diskpantry.com/)!

#### Running locally:

  1. clone the repo
  2. start a `http server` inside the folder
      - python example: `python -m http.server`
  3. visit `localhost:PORT`, where the port is the one you get from the server
  4. when refreshing, if changes aren't seen, force a browser refresh that deletes the cache since sometimes js tends to do that. for chrome you can just hit `Ctrl + F5`
